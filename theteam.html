Fellows will probably want you to call them by their first names too, but you could start with Dr. Soandso if you feel nervous. With attendings, always start with Dr. Soandso, but if they tell you to call them by their first names feel free to do so.
</h5></div>
						<p class="lefttxt">
                            <b>Intern:</b> The intern, also known as a PGY-1 (post-graduate year 1), is in his/her first year as an MD and has primary responsibility for the day-to-day needs of the patients. He/she is often overworked and sleep-deprived and will gladly welcome any help provided by students. Many interns will return the favor with informal teaching sessions related to routine work on the floor. Expect to spend much of your time with the intern. They can be an incredible source of information in preparing presentations and caring for patients. While on some rotations they do not directly evaluate medical students, on others they do, and chiefs and attendings often ask for their input at the end of the rotation.
                            <br><br><b>Resident:</b> Residents are also known as PGY 2s, 3s etc. or sometimes JARs and SARs (junior and senior admitting resident). This person makes certain that the team runs smoothly, makes routine patient care decisions, and oversees the activities of the interns and medical students. Their responsibilities will vary depending on their level of training and specialty. Residents have had more years of experience and often have the most time and interest in teaching about various topics during your rotation. The resident evaluation is a major component of the medical student grade, along with the attending evaluation.
<br><br><b>Fellow:</b> After having completed residency training in a general field, these individuals are pursuing specialty training as clinical fellows. For example, after completing seven years of training in general surgery, physicians may elect to spend three additional years of training as fellows in cardiothoracic surgery. The exact responsibilities of fellows depend on their position and field of interest. While your contact with fellows as a 200 student will be limited, you will undoubtedly encounter them when you consult subspecialty services, in the clinics, and in the operating room.
<br><br><b>House Staff:</b> All physicians in training are collectively referred to as house staff/house officers.
                            <br><br><b>Extern/Sub-Intern (Sub-I):</b> A senior medical student who is taking an advanced course in which they take on many of the responsibilities of an intern. The Extern technically is an additional student member of the team, whereas a Sub-I takes the place of an intern on a team.
<br><br><b>Attending:</b> The attending physician has completed formal training and finally has a real job. Attendings have titles such as assistant professor, associate professor and professor depending on their level of experience within the department. The attending is ultimately responsible for the care of patients on your service and accordingly will make all major decisions regarding patient management. He/she runs attending rounds and is the person to whom you will present your patients. The attending is often the person who asks you the most questions, and he/she is usually responsible for writing your primary evaluation for the team. While you should try to spend as much time with your attending as possible on the floor, in clinic, and in the OR, they are incredibly busy and often cannot be available for you. Realize that the degree to which your attending will teach you is very individual and discipline dependent.

The importance of working as a team is paramount. It allows work to be completed smoothly and efficiently, provides more time for teaching, creates a more enjoyable environment, and provides for the best care of patients.</p>

                        <div class="section-title"><h3>Other Important People</h3><h5>Allied health professionals are essential in the care of patients and can be extremely helpful to the beginning medical student. Many of the senior nurses, therapists, and clerks have outlasted generations of students and residents and, by virtue of that experience, deserve a great deal of respect. While you may think they’re being excessively critical or suspicious of you at times, it’s only because they’ve seen students make the same mistakes over and over again throughout the years. You’ll have to earn the benefit of the doubt. Be comforted by the fact that everyone ultimately has the patients’ best interests at heart.</h5><br></div>
                        <p class="lefttxt"><b>Nurses:</b> Nurses are in charge of overseeing the routine, yet vital, aspects of patient care. Among other things, they implement physician orders, monitor patient vital signs and activities, and administer supportive care. Some will insert IVs and perform routine phlebotomy. Charge nurses are nurses that supervise individual floors. Scrub nurses run operating rooms and maintain the sanctity of the sterile field. Nurse practitioners have advanced degrees and are able to perform some of the duties of a primary care physician. Nurse’s Aids (who do not have an RN degree) assist nurses in obtaining vitals and routine patient care activities. Staying on the good side of the nurses, particularly the charge nurse, is always a good idea.
<br><br><b>Ward Clerk:</b> Unit clerks handle floor business: they answer phones, schedule tests, complete paperwork, and generally keep things running smoothly. They typically sit at the nurse’s station and are an excellent source of practical information. Quickly learn which chair belongs to them, and do not ever sit there!
<br><br><b>Physical Therapy (PT):</b> Physical therapists evaluate and treat patients suffering from physical dysfunction and pain resulting from illness. They emphasize motor rehabilitation training in order to help patients regain joint mobility, strength, and coordination. = ADL's
<br><br><b>Occupational Therapy (OT):</b> Occupational therapists also deal with physical dysfunction, but their goal is to help patients (many of whom have cognitive impairments) achieve independence in daily activities through exercise, fine motor skill repetition, and family education. = IADL's
<br><br><b>Respiratory:</b> Respiratory techs go throughout the hospital to administer nebulizer treatments, perform bedside PFTs (pulmonary function tests), and adjust ventilator settings.
<br><br><b>Social Services:</b> Social workers act as liaisons between the patient and the patient’s care providers, both within the hospital and out in the community. They assess the patient’s care network outside the hospital, arrange for nursing home or chronic care placement as needed, and participate in family education and support.
<br><br><b>Nutrition:</b> A service staffed by both MDs and registered dietitians (RDs), nutrition addresses patient care issues such as intravenous nutrition, special diets, cachexia, etc.
<br><br><b>Chaplaincy:</b> Most hospitals, including HUP, offer this service, which provides inpatients (of most denominations) with worship services and spiritual counseling.</p>
