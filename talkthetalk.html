						<p class="lefttxt">The exact organization of a patient’s charted medical record is dependent on the hospital and ward in which that patient is located. It may be stored at the bedside, electronically, at some central nursing station, or in some cryptic combination of places. Fortunately, the essential components of the chart are consistent; they all contain sections for physician’s orders, administered medications, vitals, progress notes, lab and radiology results, etc. You’ll quickly learn where best to look to find or record information that is important to you. Ask residents, nurses, or the unit secretaries for help early in the month. Navigating patient charts is an essential skill that you’ll develop with experience. The chart is an important medical and legal document, so everything you write should be legible and clearly signed. Remember to have everything you write in the chart co-signed by an MD, usually your intern or resident. Always date and time your notes, and include some identifying title before each entry <i>(e.g. “MS-II Admit Note” or “MS Progress Note”)</i> and after your signature at the end of the note.

						<p class="lefttxt">You have already had a great deal of experience learning how to perform and write a History and Physical Exam. As time goes on, your H &amp P will change according to your individual style, the rotation, and the patient. Generally, your write-ups will grow more concise over the course of your clerkship year as you gain a better understanding of what is relevant and what is not relevant. At most institutions, your H &amp P will be placed on the chart, complemented by an addendum or, in some instances, an additional complete H &amp P written by the resident. Do not be discouraged by this redundancy. It is often required by hospital policy. Look at your admission note as an opportunity to organize your thoughts about the patient, to learn to be concise and pertinent, to adopt convention, and to demonstrate your understanding to the attending who will undoubtedly read most of what you contribute to the chart. The basic H &amp P format is below. You will also be asked to submit formal, typed H &amp P write-ups for some clerkships.</p>

Include pertinent positives and negatives from the review of systems. If multiple problems are present discuss them one at a time. Give attention to the duration, intensity, location, radiation, quality, onset, etc. of sx (symptoms). Include a brief synopsis of what was done in the ER, by the EMTs, at the OSH (outside hospital) prior to transfer etc. before the patient came to the floor, such as diagnostic tests and results, medications, fluids given and response.

This should be very similar to the bullet you would deliver if your attending wanted a quick summary of the patient’s history and presentation. Follow by listing each active problem numerically with the most important first. In the ICU, you will organize your assessment by organ system (pulmonary, cardiovascular, endocrine, FEN- fluid/electrolytes/metabolism, ID, GU, GI, etc.). Each of the problems you list requires an in- depth assessment (especially in Medicine) which includes a detailed differential diagnosis. Support your thoughts with elements of the patient’s history, physical findings, lab data and procedure results. Conclude with a detailed treatment plan. Don’t worry—your resident will almost always go over this with you the night before when you are on your 200 rotation!</p>

						<p class="lefttxt">In addition to the comprehensive H&amp;P, every in-house patient you help admit and follow on a
regular basis should have a daily progress note placed in the chart. At HUP, Pennsy, CHOP and
Presby, a basic follow-up note can be printed from Sunrise and filled out during morning prerounding. On some services, you may be asked to write a note using the SOAP format without a template; a basic structure of the SOAP note is given below. You don’t have to wait for all of
the day’s data to come back before writing a daily progress note as you can always write an addendum. It is very important to state that it is the “Medical Student Progress Note” as well as to include the date and time on <b><u>all</u></b> the notes or orders you write. Each page of the chart must also have the patient’s name and social security or medical record number. There are often stickers printed out at the beginning of the chart with this pertinent patient identifying information. You can use these stickers to put on the top of your progress notes.

students (and the intern) and it’s a good way to learn to anticipate possible post-op complications. Use a modified SOAP note format:

<br><br><b>O: </b>&nbsp; vitals, as well as I/O from PACU (post anesthesia care unit) and floor separately, record any drain/tube outputs, and check labs if necessary. On exam be sure to describe general mental status post anesthesia. Listen for atelectasis on pulmonary exam. Check all dressings to ensure that they are C/D/I (clean/dry/intact by convention). Finally, give attention to any potentially serious complications, e.g. an expanding hematoma in the neck following thyroid surgery that threatens the airway.

						<p class="lefttxt" style="font-size: 12px">Delivery notes are written after delivery of every infant on the labor floor. These are often completed by the OB/GYN residents, but you may be asked to write one. The general format is as follows, with the exact details determined by the circumstances of the individual delivery (adapted from Maxwell’s):<br><br>
                            On (delivery date, time), this (age, race, gravida___, para____, group B strep pos/neg) female under (epidural, pudendal, local, no) anesthesia delivered a viable (male, female) infant weighing _____ grams with APGAR scores of _____ and _____.

A post- partum note, like a post-op check note, is basically a modified SOAP note focusing on the specific concerns of a post-partum patient. These are typically written daily for post-partum patients while they are in the hospital.
<br><br>
            Post-partum day #________
<br><b>S: </b>&nbsp; Note any patient complaints or comments, as well as any nursing comments. You should also assess the patient’s current pain and pain control in past day. Note if the patient has any breast erythema/tenderness, any lower extremity swelling or tenderness, and the quantity/trend of the patient’s vaginal bleeding/discharge. Make sure to ask about urination, flatus/bowel movements (especially if it was a C-section), and ambulation. You should ask if the patient is breast and/or bottle feeding and check in about what type of birth control the patient plans to use.
<br><br><b>O: </b>&nbsp; - Vitals (BP, pulse, respirations, temperature)
<br>- Ins/Outs (IV fluids, PO intake, emesis, urine, stool)
<br>- Exam (focusing on breath sounds, bowel sounds, fundal height/consistency, incision/episiotomy condition, lower extremity tenderness/edema, Homan’s sign)
<br>- Meds (common post-partum meds: RhoGAM, pain meds, iron, vitamins, laxatives, contraception)
<br>- Labs (CBC, Rh status, rubella status, etc.)
            <br><br><b>A/P: </b>&nbsp; Assessment and plan (i.e. medications, lab tests, immunizations, consults, discharge plan)
