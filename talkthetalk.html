						<p class="lefttxt">The exact organization of a patient’s charted medical record is dependent on the hospital and ward in which that patient is located. It may be stored at the bedside, electronically, at some central nursing station, or in some cryptic combination of places. Fortunately, the essential components of the chart are consistent; they all contain sections for physician’s orders, administered medications, vitals, progress notes, lab and radiology results, etc. You’ll quickly learn where best to look to find or record information that is important to you. Ask residents, nurses, or the unit secretaries for help early in the month. Navigating patient charts is an essential skill that you’ll develop with experience. The chart is an important medical and legal document, so everything you write should be legible and clearly signed. Remember to have everything you write in the chart co-signed by an MD, usually your intern or resident. Always date and time your notes, and include some identifying title before each entry <i>(e.g. “MS-II Admit Note” or “MS Progress Note”)</i> and after your signature at the end of the note.

						<p class="lefttxt">You have already had a great deal of experience learning how to perform and write a History and Physical Exam. As time goes on, your H &amp P will change according to your individual style, the rotation, and the patient. Generally, your write-ups will grow more concise over the course of your clerkship year as you gain a better understanding of what is relevant and what is not relevant. At most institutions, your H &amp P will be placed on the chart, complemented by an addendum or, in some instances, an additional complete H &amp P written by the resident. Do not be discouraged by this redundancy. It is often required by hospital policy. Look at your admission note as an opportunity to organize your thoughts about the patient, to learn to be concise and pertinent, to adopt convention, and to demonstrate your understanding to the attending who will undoubtedly read most of what you contribute to the chart. The basic H &amp P format is below. You will also be asked to submit formal, typed H &amp P write-ups for some clerkships.</p>

                            <br><br><b>CC:</b> “In patients own words”
                            <br><br><b>HPI:</b> Begin by listing all relevant major medical problems in your first sentence (i.e., <i>Mr. M is a 45 y.o. WM with a hx of NIDDM, CAD, PVD, CRI who presents with ...)</i>. Describe all episodes and conditions leading up to and relevant to the reason for admission. Include pertinent positives and negatives from the review of systems. If multiple problems are present discuss them one at a time. Give attention to the duration, intensity, location, radiation, quality, onset, etc. of sx (symptoms). Include a brief synopsis of what was done in the ER, by the EMTs, at the OSH (outside hospital) prior to transfer etc. before the patient came to the floor, such as diagnostic tests and results, medications, fluids given and response. All PMHx relevant to this admission should be detailed, including admissions, ongoing treatments, etc. A chronological structure to the HPI is preferred by most attendings, so try to organize things by when they happened.
                            <br><br><b>PMH:</b> Describe major illnesses (childhood & adult) with a brief discussion of duration, treatment, and control: <i>e.g., rheumatic fever, HTN x 10 yrs. well controlled with meds, s/p CVA ‘91 w/ residual left sided weakness.</i>
Hospitalizations: reason for admission, when, where, treatments?
Surgical procedures w/ dates: Indications? Trauma/Injury: residual defects or limitations? Immunizations (most relevant in peds) Transfusions
                            <br><br><b>Meds:</b> Include dosage and duration. Does the patient actually take them? Don't forget to include over-the-counter drugs and herbal meds. Look back to the PMH to see if the patient may have forgotten to mention a chronic illness indicated by the med list.
                            <br><br><b>All:</b> Record allergies and reactions to medications and foods, or NKDA (No Known Drug Allergies).
                            <br><br><b>FH:</b> Include inherited diseases: ex. diabetes, heart disease, HTN, cancer, mental illness in all immediate family memberse.g., (+) <i>HTN in mother</i>, (+) <i>DM in mother and sister, otherwise (-) for heart dz, CA, mental illness.</i>
                            <br><br><b>SH:</b> Occupation: mention of relevant exposures to asbestos, etc.
In older patients, note their functional status here
Marital status, Children, Living arrangements:
Education:
Tobacco hx: estimate total pack yrs, currently smoking? If not, when did they quit? ETOH use: estimate frequency and quantity.
IV or other illicit drug use:
                            <br><br><b>ROS:</b> Be complete for medicine. Pertinent positives and negatives are usually in the HPI. On many rotations it will be entirely acceptable to write: “ROS as per HPI, otherwise negative.”

						<p class="lefttxt" style="font-size: 12px"><b>PE:</b> Abbreviations are difficult at first, but are pretty much standardized, so you’ll see the same ones over and over again with time, to the point where you adopt most of them in your own notes. Below is a list of common abbreviations in a typical and fairly complete, benign PE.
General: B/L = bilateral; c/ = with; s/ = without; NT = non-tender.

This should be very similar to the bullet you would deliver if your attending wanted a quick summary of the patient’s history and presentation. Follow by listing each active problem numerically with the most important first. In the ICU, you will organize your assessment by organ system (pulmonary, cardiovascular, endocrine, FEN- fluid/electrolytes/metabolism, ID, GU, GI, etc.). Each of the problems you list requires an in- depth assessment (especially in Medicine) which includes a detailed differential diagnosis. Support your thoughts with elements of the patient’s history, physical findings, lab data and procedure results. Conclude with a detailed treatment plan. Don’t worry—your resident will almost always go over this with you the night before when you are on your 200 rotation!</p>
