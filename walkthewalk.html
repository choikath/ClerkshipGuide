						<p class="lefttxt">While your responsibilities and opportunities as a student will vary a great deal from month to month depending on the clinical rotation and your team, the basic structure and general principles that direct your activities are consistent throughout the clerkships.
Your ability to get organized and stay organized will be very important in your future as a student, a resident, and eventually as an attending physician. Regardless of your rotation schedule, you will quickly develop a personal system for recording and accessing patient information. You will undoubtedly experiment with different systems and will slowly adopt elements of your residents’ and fellow students’ practices.
<br><br>Most students and residents use printed copies of the day’s signout, accessed from Sunrise, to take notes on pertinent information for the patients they are following. You can also carry a stack of bound index cards, with a different card dedicated to each of the patients that you are following. Some carry a clipboard with a separate sheet for each patient, while others manage with loose, jumbled scraps of paper. Many students opt to create their own sheets with pre- printed patient information templates. You can find some examples of these forms on the MSG website under “Clinics” in the Digital Archives.

<br><br>• &nbsp;A list of active medical problems and planned management.
<br><br>• &nbsp;Results of relevant labs, cultures and diagnostic tests. These will accumulate quickly, but
you should record them in a table, as trends will be important. You will be expected to
have all of your patients’ lab results easily accessible.

						<p class="lefttxt">Regardless of the specialty, all of your clinical rotations involving the care of inpatients will involve rounds. Rounds take many different forms but, most simply, provide structure for the interaction between the patient and the health care team, and between members of the health care team itself. For some of your clinical rotations, you will be responsible for individual patients. For example, during your rotations in medicine and pediatrics, you will “pick-up” individual patients admitted on your call night. You will be most involved in the care of these patients throughout their hospitalization, and these will be the patients you follow and present on a daily basis during rounds. Alternatively, on your surgical rotations, you will make small contributions to the care of all of the patients on your service as a team member and will not necessarily follow individual patients. Again, while your specific responsibilities will vary, the majority of your clinical experiences will involve rounds.</p>

    <div class="row-content buffer even clear-after"> <h5><i>The following section applies primarily to rotations in which you will follow individual patients, such as in medicine and pediatrics, but the general principles apply to the majority of your clerkships.</i></h5>
                        
                        <div class="section-title" id="prerounds"><h3>Pre-rounds</h3><br></div>
						<p class="lefttxt">On most services, you will begin a typical day “pre-rounding” on your patients. The goal is to find out what happened with the patient since you left the night before so that you can update the team on the patient’s progress. This includes: <br><br>

                            • Checking current vital signs: temperature at the time (Tcurrent) and maximum temperature overnight or over the past 24 hours (Tmax), BP, heart rate, respiratory rate, and pulse ox (always record the level of oxygenation – e.g. “on room air”, “2L nasal cannula”), total intake and output (I’s &amp O’s) over the previous 24 hours, weight if appropriate, drainage from any surgical drains/chest tubes, finger stick blood glucose, etc. In most hospitals, all of this data is summarized on one sheet of paper in the chart. This “flowsheet” can be a bear to navigate at first, but you’ll quickly learn how to draw out the information you need, even on patients in the unit. If vitals ever look wrong or unexpected, definitely check them again yourself and look for trends. Vitals are often presented as the range of values over the past 24 hours (“heart rate ranged from 75 to 115 in the past day”), and sometimes it is useful to note when any abnormal values occurred (“the heart rate was within normal limits except for when it reached 115 during the fever at 6PM yesterday”).<br><br>
• Review any new progress notes and orders in your patient’s chart. Consultants and attendings will often round after you’ve left for the night, and you’ll want to be up to date on all new activity in the chart. Often consultations are recorded in a separate section of the chart, so make sure not to overlook this section if you are expecting a note. Also look for notes written by the on-call resident overnight. When you start a new rotation, you should check with the intern to see if they would like you to get signout from the overnight team or if they want to do it themselves; signout is key in getting overnight updates on your patients, but the intern may prefer doing all of their signouts at once and then passing the information on to you. Review orders to see if there have been any major changes and/or if any consultant recommendations have been implemented.<br><br>
• Don’t be surprised if the intern knows things that you don’t: they were either the one there all night, or they got a quick morning report from the on-call intern. (Try to ask the intern if there is anything you should know about your patient before rounds so that you can present the information to the attending instead of having the intern report the updates. But don’t be offended if the intern forgets to touch base with you before rounds, they’re just busy and it’s not intended to make you look bad.)<br><br>
• Check pending labs, cultures and diagnostic tests.<br><br>
• Talk with the patient about any problems overnight, changes in their symptoms, new
complaints, etc. This is important, as much of the day’s treatment plan is based on the patient’s subjective report.<br><br>
• Perform a brief, directed physical exam: This always includes the basic four systems (heart, lungs, abdomen, extremities) as well as relevant systems for that patient (e.g. surgical wounds).<br><br>
This list seems exhaustive at first, and it will probably take a couple weeks before you feel entirely comfortable with the process. Don’t be discouraged if you miss information early in your rotations. You’ll get better and faster every day, and each patient will only take about five minutes with practice (early on, be sure to leave yourself about a half hour per patient). Since each patient is also the intern’s responsibility he/she will usually also pre-round on your patients, and your resident might as well. If there’s time before rounds, the intern may kindly review any important developments with you before your presentation.
On surgical rotations, expect to pre-round on more patients, but in MUCH less depth. Your intern and residents will let you know exactly what information they like to hear on rounds. They often just want to know overnight vital signs, and fluid intake and output, but if they don’t tell you what they expect, you should ask.</p>

                        <div class="section-title" id="resrounds"><h3>Resident Rounds/Work Rounds</h3><br><h5></h5></div>
                        <p class="lefttxt">After pre-rounding on surgical rotations, the housestaff team (usually without attendings) will review each patient’s progress and plan basic care for the day. Work rounds are usually done as “walk rounds” where the entire team moves from room to room to see each patient. Occasionally teams may have “sit-down rounds” in a conference room prior to seeing the patients. When the team gets to one of your patients, briefly summarize the pertinent data from your pre-rounding, including your ideas for a daily plan. Use the <b>SOAP</b> format (subjective, objective, assessment, plan) that you will also use for the written progress note (see page 19 for more details). Presentations should be concise but complete, noting patient name, age, current problems, vitals, pertinent exam findings, study results and assessment/plan. For example:
</p>
<p><br>                        
<i>P.D. is our 60 year-old gentleman with CHF (congestive heart failure) admitted two days ago for rule out MI. He reports no new problems overnight. His breathing is reportedly “better” although still not back to baseline. He denies any new chest pain, palpitations, or diaphoresis. He is afebrile now with a Tmax of 99.6°, BP 130/90 and stable, pulse in the 80s, respirations 14 -16, and pulse ox of 96% on 4L oxygen by nasal cannula (NC). I’s and O’s yesterday 1500 cc/2400cc for net 900cc negative. On exam, his JVD is down to 8 cm. Unchanged bibasilar crackles and 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities. Cardiac enzymes and EKG are pending. Plan is to increase his dose of Lasix and repeat chest x-ray (CXR) today.</i><br></p>
<p><br>Work rounds are highly chief resident or fellow dependent. While the above model is a good start, mold your presentations to her/his preferences. With practice you will likely start work rounds with a mostly pre-written daily progress note/SOAP note for each of your patients that you can complete as your team agrees on an assessment and plan. Again, this will vary Occasionally you may need to have the note in the chart before rounds, in which case you can make a photocopy of the note to help you in your presentation. However, these notes are very brief and get much easier to write with practice. The amount of teaching you will receive during work rounds is variable, depending on the style of the resident and the number of patients on the service, as well as their level of acuity and complexity.</p>                        
                </div>
                    </section>
                    
                    
                    <section class="row section">
					<div class="row-content buffer even clear-after">
                        
                        <div class="section-title" id="attgrounds"><h3>Attending Rounds</h3><br></div>
						<p class="lefttxt">Attending rounds are generally held soon after work rounds, but again, this varies with the service. These rounds provide an opportunity for the team to present and discuss old and new patients with the attending. Brief follow-ups on old patients often begin with a bullet presentation, such as: <i>“M.W., our 45 yo with h/o (history of) CABG (coronary artery bypass grafting) admitted 2 days ago with CHF (congestive heart failure) exacerbation, continues to diurese well on Lasix with improving pulmonary exam.”</i> The structure of presentations on old patients is entirely attending dependent, but it is advisable to start with a more formal presentation even if the interns say something more like <i>“MW is unchanged”</i>. In addition, this is your time to present the complete H&amp;P on patients you helped admit on call nights. You will likely have discussed your patient with the admitting resident the night before and may have had some opportunity to go over the case on work rounds. Many interns will volunteer to listen to a practice presentation prior to attending rounds. Take them up on it! They will undoubtedly have invaluable advice on content and style, especially early in the month. This is often your only contact with the attending, and a well-rehearsed presentation will make a great impression. This is definitely something that gets easier with each presentation. Do not sacrifice completeness early on because you feel compelled not to read from your notes. Start by delivering some of the HPI from memory and gradually add more and more components of the presentation. Feel free to ask your attending or resident about style preferences for the presentation; most will tell you if they have something else in mind, so be flexible.
<br><br>You should have read enough about your patient’s disease the night before to be able to answer the majority of questions that your attending will inevitably ask. Don’t worry about this too much. Read for your own education and understanding with some anticipation of likely questions, and you’ll do very well. Consider differential diagnoses, presentation, clinical course, treatments and prognoses. Think about the little things as well; e.g. be somewhat familiar with <b>all</b> of the patients medications and why they’re taking them. Often, especially on the medicine rotation, your resident will sit with you the night before to discuss the patient and prepare you for questions that the attending will likely ask. Remember, you are absolutely not expected to have an answer to every question. Attendings will often use a line of questioning to lead off a teaching session and even the hardest questions of the morning are directed to the most junior person in the room first (always you) before it trickles up to the chief resident. This is somewhat of a convention. Have fun with the whole pimping process. Look at it as a chance to show what you’ve learned, to have fun thinking on the fly and, above all, to learn in the process.
<br><br>Attending rounds are variable from specialty to specialty, and formal attending rounds may not exist on some of your rotations. Surgical attendings often walk round between or after cases with only the chief resident or fellow, or they may round with the entire team at the end of the day. While you may have the opportunity to give bullet presentations on these rounds, you will likely not give lengthy H&amp;Ps. Alternatively, you will have many opportunities to present new patients directly to the attending during clinic hours. While these presentations will be more directed, the usual style and general format apply.</p>

                        <p class="lefttxt">Because inpatient medical and surgical services have patients in the hospital all day, every day, members of the team must be in the hospital at all times to care for these patients. At the end of the day, when the rest of the team goes home, someone has to stay overnight. During these nights (known as call), house officers have responsibility for admitting new patients to the hospital and taking care of medical issues on old patients that can’t wait until morning. As a student, your call schedule and corresponding responsibilities will vary from rotation to rotation. On medicine and pediatric services, your primary objective will be to help admit one or two new patients that you can present to the attending the next morning. While waiting for an interesting admission to come to your service, you should help your resident with the more routine duties of patient management. Once your new patient has been admitted and settled for the night, you should get home to work on your presentation and do the appropriate relevant reading. Alternatively, during some surgical specialties (e.g., trauma), you may be expected to take some overnight call and/or be on call from home (e.g., transplant services). During your OB/GYN rotation, you may have a week of “night float” where you’ll work from approximately 7pm to 7am to have the ultimate middle-of-the-night labor and delivery experience. Although exhausting, call can be an incredibly rewarding and exciting experience for students. Because you’re one of the few people in the hospital, you have greater responsibility and opportunity in the care of your patients. The specific call responsibilities for each clerkship are detailed in the individual clerkship sections later in this guide.

The contents of your pockets will vary between rotations and with experience, but in general:
                            <br><br><b>For the minimalist:</b>
<br><br>1. Stethoscope: put your name on it with tape, a patient ID bracelet, or some other tag—and never let it out of your sight.
<br>2. Reference handbook for current rotation; e.g. Pocket Medicine —useful for almost all rotations!
<br>3. Maxwell Cards for quick reference for normal lab values, standard forms for notes, etc.
<br>4. Note cards, paper, or whatever else you feel comfortable using to keep patient information
organized and easily accessible.
<br>5. Several pens: Have lots of them because you will lose them and/or lend them out. Most
hospitals require black ink for charts.
<br>6. Penlight.
<br>7. PDA w/ Epocrates or Tarascon’s Pocket Pharmacopoeia: this tiny, relatively inexpensive book has almost every medication with dosing guidelines. Invaluable for learning to write prescriptions and orders.
                            <br><br><b>Also useful:</b>
<br><br>8. Jay Sanford's Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy
<br>9. Scissors (especially for surgical rotations): a great source are the disposable suture kits in the Omnicell. The huge trauma scissors are great for taking down dressings.
                            <br>9. Tape, gauze, gloves, ABG kits, lubricant, hemoccult cards, tourniquets, etc. (somehow these things find their own way into your pockets so don’t worry too much about collecting them).
<br><br>Rotation specific accessories such as a gestation wheel in obstetrics, a reflex hammer for neurology and medicine, growth charts in pediatrics, and skin staple removers in surgery will become obvious as you go along. Detailed recommendations are included later in the sections dedicated to each clerkship. Carry things that make you comfortable. If you’ll feel better knowing you have a table of normal lab values in your coat pocket, definitely put one in there. You’ll feel more and more comfortable without certain things as your coat gets heavier, but you need to come to that point on your own.
