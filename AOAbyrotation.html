</h3><br><h5>The four-block system designed for Module 4 combines different specialties of medicine that have some similarities in content and approach. Each student will rotate through four 12-week blocks that include two or three separate clerkships and integrated didactic material. There are generally multiple locations at which the clerkships can be completed, and you will have an opportunity to select among these sites. When more than one site is offered, there is typically some variation between them, and you will want to talk to other students to find out which site may best match your interests. Ultimately, however, there is central standardization by the course director in terms of grading requirements. For most clerkships, regardless of your site, you will be at HUP on Fridays for didactic lectures. Course specifics such as weekly schedules, write-up requirements, lecture topics, and evaluation schemes have been excluded from the following discussion. These materials will appropriately be given to you on the first day of every rotation.</h5></div>

						<p class="lefttxt">The 12-week medicine block is broken down into 8 weeks of inpatient medicine and 4 weeks of family medicine. Your inpatient experience will take place at HUP, Presbyterian Hospital, Pennsylvania Hospital, or the VA (often a combination of two of these sites) and will vary somewhat according to site. There are pros and cons to each site; however, the general “rules” remain the same at all of them, and historically this is the only rotation where students do not have a say in their site. Dr. Jen Kogan will give you a detailed overview of exactly what is expected of you during your inpatient medicine block on the first day of your rotation. In short, inpatient medicine is a fun, but rigorous, 8 weeks. During this time, you will feel more like a “doctor” than you will on most other rotations – you will have quite a bit of responsibility and will hopefully feel like you’re learning something each day.
Family medicine is a 4-week block that most students really enjoy, regardless of what they plan to go into. During this time, you will see patients of all ages and with a large variety of concerns, from children needing well-child care, to pregnant patients, to the elderly.

						<p class="lefttxt">Grouping the pediatrics and obstetrics/gynecology clerkships into a single clinical block facilitates an integrated curriculum designed to present topics from the perspective of both clinical disciplines. The 12-week block is divided equally between OB/GYN and Peds. Each individual discipline will have its own teaching curriculum with didactic sessions and problem- based learning. The integrated teaching curriculum covers issues such as prematurity, adolescent health, domestic violence and reproductive technology.

						<p class="lefttxt">This clinical block consists of 6 weeks of psychiatry, 3 weeks of neurology, and 1 week each of the O’s (oto, ophtho, ortho). Psychiatry and neurology are graded honors/high pass/pass/low pass/fail, while the O’s are graded pass/fail. Thus, some consider this block to be relatively less stressful than the other rotations, but as in all rotations, it is often what you make of it. As a first block, it can be a smoother and gentler way to transition into clinical rotations and the workings of the hospital. As a later block, it can be a way to consolidate some of the information you have learned from your previous rotations.
<br><br><br></p>
        <h5 class="centertxt">Psychiatry</h5><p><br>Psychiatry will be a unique component of your clinical experience because it focuses on human thought and behavior, examining the psychological and social dimensions of illness. As a 200 student, you’ll become very familiar with the psychiatric history and complete mental status examination. You’ll be challenged to formulate a reasonable differential diagnosis based on the diagnostic scheme (axis) of the DSM-IV (The American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders). You will also be involved in the application of psycho-pharmacological agents and non-somatic modalities of care. Regardless of whether or not psychiatry is your career field of choice, you will be expected to strengthen your interpersonal and interview skills and become aware of the psychological issues in medicine. Ideally, students will learn to become more sensitive to the existence of psychiatric issues in all patients and to recognize the indications for psychiatric evaluation.
<br><br>Your psych experience will be similar to other rotations in that you will pick up new patients and follow their daily progress throughout the course of their admission to the hospital. You will often be interviewing patients in front of your entire team, including other students and attendings. Students should become familiar with the Mental Status Exam as it replaces the physical exam component of the patient interview and note. More specific requirements, such as write-ups and presentation will vary by institution and service. You will also have the opportunity to participate in hospital consult services, where you will be able to see how somatic disease and psychiatric illness interface. Every student participates in outpatient experiences at the VA and/or the Resident Clinic at 3535 Market Street and spends a few evenings at the psychiatric emergency evaluation centers at HUP (PEEC) or Pennsy (CRC). You will also have some scheduled experiences with the CHOP psychiatry team (a consult-only team, with no inpatients of their own). You will be provided a schedule of your specific activities at the beginning of your rotation.</p>

        <br><br><br></p>
         <h5 class="centertxt">Neurology</h5><p><br>The neurology block is a great opportunity to learn about the various major diseases involving the central and peripheral nervous system. On the first day of the rotation, you will meet as a group with the course director, Dr. Amy Pruitt and choose which type of clinical experience you would like to have. You may choose to do a rotation in pediatric neurology, inpatient neurology, or consult service. The sites also vary in terms of hours and expectations, so try to find out from your friends about the various sites.
<br><br>Throughout the rotation, you will meet regularly for lectures that will cover a lot of the material you will need for the shelf. The course director will also provide you with a syllabus of materials. The inpatient experiences should be very similar to your core rotation in inpatient medicine in that you will help admit, work up, manage, and follow specific patients throughout the course of their admission. On a consult service, you will see how neurologic issues may affect patients on other specialty services. Presentations and notes should follow the standard format, with the addition of a directed neurologic history, comprehensive neurologic exam, and underlying appreciation for relevant neuroanatomy. You may be asked to prepare a topic presentation to present to your team—see the “Sample Documents” packet for an example of a Neurology topic presentation.
<br><br>The most important aspect of this course is to get comfortable with performing a neurologic exam. If you choose to do your rotation at CHOP, you may need to spend a little extra time mastering some of the adult neurological issues for the exam. With pediatric patients, keep in mind that at different ages, some aspects of the neuro exam are not applicable or need to be approached in a different manner. You may want to get a copy of the Denver developmental milestones sheet to get an idea of what is appropriate behavior given a child’s age. A small finger puppet may be helpful when trying to assess a child’s extraocular eye movements.

						<p class="lefttxt">The combination of these three disciplines into a single clinical block allows for an integrated curriculum to best present clinical issues commonly encountered among practitioners in all three fields. Lectures and case- and problem-based learning sessions will address interdisciplinary topics including shock, fluids and electrolytes, hemodynamics, coagulation, peri-operative management, and trauma/critical care. Additionally, rotation-specific curricula will address topics more relevant to each discipline to compliment your clinical experience.
<br><br><br></p>
         <h5 class="centertxt">Surgery</h5><p><br><b>Disclaimer:</b><br>A testament to Penn’s commitment to providing the best medical education experience, the Surgery Clerkship is continually improving. As a result, we urge you to check with the Course Director, Dr. Rachel Kelz, for any updates as recent changes to this clerkship may have been made after the printing of this booklet.<br><br> <b>Overview:</b><br>
The “Surgery block” is an 8-week period broken into 4 weeks of general surgery and 4 weeks of surgical subspecialties (cardiac, thoracic, bariatric, vascular, plastics, urology, etc.). As a 200 student you will complete one 4-week block of general surgery (graded Honors, High Pass, Pass, Low Pass, Fail) and two 2-week blocks of surgical subspecialty (graded Pass/Fail). This schedule affords most students both a broad surgical experience and a detailed view of the life of a surgeon.

        <br><br>
        <h5 class="centertxt">Anesthesiology</h5><p><br>The week-long pass/fail clinical rotation in anesthesiology is a great experience for 200 level students. Over the course of the week, you will help with all aspects of pre-operative, intra- operative and post-operative patient management. You will spend two days in the main HUP operating rooms, working with a resident and an attending, and two days completing electives in subspecialties of anesthesiology, including cardiac anesthesia, pediatric anesthesia, obstetrical anesthesia, regional anesthesia, pain medicine, and palliative medicine. Your experience will depend greatly on the residents you work with, the types of cases involved, and your interest level and motivation. In general, all of the residents are very excited about teaching medical students and clearly love their field. You can expect to learn a good deal about the induction of anesthesia, general anesthesia, local anesthesia, and the monitoring of physiologic functioning and how to respond to changes in those functions. You’ll also have great opportunities to practice IV insertion, placement of arterial lines, mask ventilation, and endotracheal intubation. Clinical experience is supplemented by a highly regarded lecture series covering important topics including local anesthetics, anesthesia risks, pain management and conscious sedation. Relevant readings will be provided—no textbook is necessary.
