						<p class="lefttxt">The 12-week medicine block is broken down into 8 weeks of inpatient medicine and 4 weeks of family medicine. Your inpatient experience will take place at HUP, Presbyterian Hospital, Pennsylvania Hospital, or the VA (often a combination of two of these sites) and will vary somewhat according to site. There are pros and cons to each site; however, the general “rules” remain the same at all of them, and historically this is the only rotation where students do not have a say in their site. Dr. Jen Kogan will give you a detailed overview of exactly what is expected of you during your inpatient medicine block on the first day of your rotation. In short, inpatient medicine is a fun, but rigorous, 8 weeks. During this time, you will feel more like a “doctor” than you will on most other rotations – you will have quite a bit of responsibility and will hopefully feel like you’re learning something each day.
Family medicine is a 4-week block that most students really enjoy, regardless of what they plan to go into. During this time, you will see patients of all ages and with a large variety of concerns, from children needing well-child care, to pregnant patients, to the elderly.

						<p class="lefttxt" style="font-size: 12px">Patient Name: MR Number:
￼<br>Date: Time: 
                            <br>Source of Hx: Patient, Family, Old Records, etc.
                            <br><br><b>CC:</b> “In patients own words”
                            <br><br><b>HPI:</b> Begin by listing all relevant major medical problems in your first sentence (i.e., <i>Mr. M is a 45 y.o. WM with a hx of NIDDM, CAD, PVD, CRI who presents with ...)</i>. Describe all episodes and conditions leading up to and relevant to the reason for admission. Include pertinent positives and negatives from the review of systems. If multiple problems are present discuss them one at a time. Give attention to the duration, intensity, location, radiation, quality, onset, etc. of sx (symptoms). Include a brief synopsis of what was done in the ER, by the EMTs, at the OSH (outside hospital) prior to transfer etc. before the patient came to the floor, such as diagnostic tests and results, medications, fluids given and response. All PMHx relevant to this admission should be detailed, including admissions, ongoing treatments, etc. A chronological structure to the HPI is preferred by most attendings, so try to organize things by when they happened.
                            <br><br><b>PMH:</b> Describe major illnesses (childhood & adult) with a brief discussion of duration, treatment, and control: <i>e.g., rheumatic fever, HTN x 10 yrs. well controlled with meds, s/p CVA ‘91 w/ residual left sided weakness.</i>
Hospitalizations: reason for admission, when, where, treatments?
Surgical procedures w/ dates: Indications? Trauma/Injury: residual defects or limitations? Immunizations (most relevant in peds) Transfusions
                            <br><br><b>Meds:</b> Include dosage and duration. Does the patient actually take them? Don't forget to include over-the-counter drugs and herbal meds. Look back to the PMH to see if the patient may have forgotten to mention a chronic illness indicated by the med list.
                            <br><br><b>All:</b> Record allergies and reactions to medications and foods, or NKDA (No Known Drug Allergies).
                            <br><br><b>FH:</b> Include inherited diseases: ex. diabetes, heart disease, HTN, cancer, mental illness in all immediate family memberse.g., (+) <i>HTN in mother</i>, (+) <i>DM in mother and sister, otherwise (-) for heart dz, CA, mental illness.</i>
                            <br><br><b>SH:</b> Occupation: mention of relevant exposures to asbestos, etc.
In older patients, note their functional status here
Marital status, Children, Living arrangements:
Education:
Tobacco hx: estimate total pack yrs, currently smoking? If not, when did they quit? ETOH use: estimate frequency and quantity.
IV or other illicit drug use:
                            <br><br><b>ROS:</b> Be complete for medicine. Pertinent positives and negatives are usually in the HPI. On many rotations it will be entirely acceptable to write: “ROS as per HPI, otherwise negative.”
                            <br><br><b>PE:</b> Abbreviations are difficult at first, but are pretty much standardized, so you’ll see the same ones over and over again with time, to the point where you adopt most of them in your own notes. Below is a list of common abbreviations in a typical and fairly complete, benign PE.
General: B/L = bilateral; c/ = with; s/ = without; NT = non-tender.</p>
