						<p class="lefttxt">In addition to attending mini-lectures given by senior members of the team on topics relevant to the care of patients on your service, you will also often be expected to give at least one brief prepared topic presentation during the course of a rotation. Seek advice from your residents about the length and degree of detail expected in these presentations. In general, focus on basic principles rather than minutiae, and remember that a concise and complete discussion is better than an exhaustive dissertation. If the attending specifies that he/she wants to hear a 5-minute presentation, be sure to keep it to 5 minutes because some attendings will cut you off if it’s too long. It helps to practice the talk and time it the night before. A one-page handout (one- or two- sided) is also a nice touch and adds structure to the presentation. Here is a general outline of how to approach a topic presentation:
</p><p><br>1) Try to pick a topic relevant to either a patient you are following or another patient on the service.
<br>2) Narrow your topic as much as possible. For example, if you choose to do a presentation on heart failure, narrow it to a specific cause (e.g. amyloid cardiomyopathy) and then narrow it even further (e.g. heart transplant in amyloid cardiomyopathy).
<br>3) Start with a 2-3 sentence presentation of your patient.
<br>4) Cover the BASIC epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis.
<br>5) Include a discussion of one or a few relevant papers. You can find papers of interest by doing a Pubmed search for your key terms.
<br>6) Have this information on a one-page handout (one-sided or two-sided). Feel free to have almost all of what you are going to say on it or an outline from which you will add information from memory. Check out some example handouts from past AOA students in the “Sample Documents” booklet.
<br>7) In general, UpToDate is extremely useful for the basic facts of your presentation and the reference list from UpToDate articles can be very useful. However, it is always good to do a Pubmed search if possible to find a few original articles of interest or just a great review article.
